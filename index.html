                    Hela Odinsdottir was the Asgardian goddess of death and former Executioner of Asgard.
                    Imprisoned in Hel for millennia by her father Odin, Hela was only released from her prison in the wake of his death
                    and went to restore her power over Asgard while simultaneously engaging in a series of encounters with her younger brothers Thor and Loki.
                    Gaining her power from Asgard, Hela planned to rule Asgard and create an Asgardian Empire.
                    When all the people of Asgard refused to bow to her, Hela set about massacring Odin's armies and enslaving their people,
                    while recruiting Skurge to be her own Executioner in the process. Eventually, however, Thor then returned with the newly formed Revengers
                    and then reengaged Hela, which had then resulted with Loki unleashing Surtur, who then destroyed Asgard by finally causing Ragnarök and killed Hela as a result.

                    Hela was the firstborn child of Odin, king of Asgard. She served as his personal executioner and commander of the Einherjar, Asgard's army.
                    Together, Hela and Odin embarked on a bloody conquest, bringing all of the Nine Realms into Asgard's power.
                    During their campaigns, Odin rode his steed, Sleipnir while Hela mounted a giant wolf named Fenris.
                    In battle, she wielded the mighty hammer Mjølnir and her own Necroswords.

                                As the eldest child of Odin, Hela had tremendous superhuman abilities and supernatural powers,
                                far superior to those of almost every other Asgardian. She also had a supernatural connection
                                to Asgard and drew power from it, enabling her to perform supernatural feats.

                                As an Asgardian, specifically the first born of Odin, Hela is the second strongest Asgardian of her time,
                                only surpassed by Odin himself. Hela possesses tremendous levels of superhuman strength, enabling her to single-handedly
                                wipe out all the Valkyrie but one, who barely survived. She was also able to catch Mjølnir, one of the most powerful weapons
                                in existence, with one hand after it was thrown at her with full speed, crushing it with no visible effort.

                                Hela's body, much like Thor's, was nigh-invulnerable, but to a much greater degree.Thor struck her with a massive lightning blast,
                                only for her to emerge completely unharmed. Only the revived and fully powered Surtur's Twilight Sword was able to crush her.
                                Apart from the Fire Demon, Odin was the only being capable of doing any significant harm to Hela.

                                Despite her body's resistance, Hela could still be injured like any other Asgardian. However,
                                her metabolism enabled her to rapidly regenerate damaged bodily tissue with far greater speed and
                                efficiency than any normal human being, and even most Asgardians.

                                Due to her connection to Asgard, Hela was immortal as long as Asgard existed, with her death coinciding

                                After returning to Asgard, Hela was also able to repair the damage to her clothing and make her headdress appear and disappear
                                from her head. Her armor enhances her already tremendous durability and allows her to block strikes her enemies.
